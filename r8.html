  <h1>Rotation Eight: Soldering & Electronics</h1>

  <p>
    In this rotation, we learned the basics of electronics and how to sauter them. There are many different parts that are required for
    electronic devices to function. Some of the basic ones are capacitors, transistors, resistors, LEDs, diodes, potentiometers, breadboards, 
    multimeters and switches. A capacitor charges and discharges the electric charge stored in it. A transistor amplifies or switches electronic
    signals and electrical power. A resistor controls the flow of electric current. An LED emits light when a current flows through it. A 
    diode allows an electric current to pass in one direction while blocking the current in the other direction. A potentiometer controls
    the output of an electrical circuit, such as volume. A breadboard is where all of the electronic devices are linked together. A
    multimeter is a device that measures voltage, current, and resistance. A switch turns the flow of current on or off.
