  <h1>Rotation Three: Garment, Mug, & Sublimation Printing</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p>
    In this rotation, we learned the basics of designing garments and sublimation printing. I had to make three different
    products: a tshirt, a mug, and a popsocket.

  <p>
    The first product, the tshirt, had to be related to either Ohio, Hudson, or WRA.
    I chose to make a WRA tshirt with a picture of the chapel in the center. To do this, I first had to create my design on CorelDRAW.
    Once I completed my design, I had to transport that image file to our tshirt design software called GTX Graphics Lab. I then had to
    transport that file to the tshirt printing machine. I pressed my tshirt to remove the wrinkled, then put it in the machine to print
    the design. After it was finished, I pressed it one more time to dry the wet ink. Overall, I'm happy with the way it turned out and
    it's a very quick and easy way to design tshirts.

    The second product that I made was a mug that I designed. I chose to design an Ayn Rand themed mug with one of her more famous quotes
    next to her face. In order to do this I had to create my design using CorelDRAW with a template of the mug's dimensions. After I
    finished designing, I had to mirror the whole thing so it would look the way I wanted when I put it on the mug. Then I printed
    out the design and taped it on a blank mug. I then had to put it in the mug press for five minutes on 400 degrees. When that process
    was finished, I took the mug out, removed the tape, and put it in a bucket of water to cool. I am really satisfied with the way
    the mug turned out, and I believe products like these have a lot of market potential if made well, as they are so easy to make
    and very awesome looking.

    The finals products I made were popsockets with my own designs. I made one of the general Hannibal Barca, one of the philosopher
    Max Stirner, and one of the economist Thomas Sowell. To create these, I first had to create the designs in CorelDRAW using the
    parameters of a popsocket (1.5x1.5 inches). I then had to use the sublimation printer to align the parameters on the popsocket
    so that it would print on the right spot. I then transported my designs to the sublimation printer's computer and printed them
    out. I will say, that the sublimation printer is much harder to use than the tshirt printer or mug press, and all three of my
    popsockets were off. It could be a very useful and productive machine if used correctly, which will take a lot more practice.
