  <h1>Rotation Six: Stickers, Vinyl Cutting, & Casting</h1>

    In this rotation, we had to make two stickers using the Roland 540i printer, two vinyl stickers using the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1, and a
    custom wax mold to make chocolates. The Roland 540i printer can print multiple colors in a single sticker while the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1
    can only print in one color.

    I first made the two stickers with the Roland 540i printer. I first searched the web for images to use then I imported them into
    CorelDRAW. Then I created boundaries around the images and made outside contour boxes. After I created the outside contour boxes, I had
    to change them from black to a specific pink color that the printer would recognize as the line to cut. I then exported the files as
    .eps files (Encapsulated PostScript) and I transported them to the printer. I imported my files, scaled them to my desired size,
    printed them, and stuck them into my notebook.

    Second, I made two stickers with the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1 printer. To do this I had to first find two images from the web to turn into
    stickers. I then transported those images straight to the computer that is linked with the printer. On that computer, I turned the
    images into simple black-and-white outlines because the printer can only cut lines in the vinyl. I put pieces of vinyl into the
    printer, had the printer measure them, and scaled my outlines to fit within the margins. Finally I printed my stickers and peeled
    them out of the paper to stick into my notebook.
