  <h1>Rotation Seven: Lamination & Vacuum Forming</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p>
    In this rotation, we had to invoke our inner Noah FS and make our own skateboards! The process of creating the skateboard contains
    numerous steps. First, I had to select the wooden boards that I would use. I grabbed a stack of 7 thin wooden planks which were
    oriented either vertically or horizontally to ensure the stability of the board. I then had to glue the boards together in less than 5
    minutes because once the first bit of glue is applied, it won't take long for it to dry. With the help of my partner, I rolled a layer
    of glue on all of the boards and attached them together. Now that I had my seven boards attached, I had to seal them in a plastic bag,
    forming a vacuum, so that they would stick very cohesively together without any gaps in between the boards. I put my glued boards in
    the plastic bag and sealed off the opening with some strong butyl tape. In order to get all of the air out of the bag, I had to use
    an air pump to suck all of it out. Once the board was tightly sealed in the plastic bag, I left it overnight for the glue to dry and
    form a solid skateboard. The next day when I entered the building, I removed my skateboard from the bag. It had glued together very
    nicely and formed a distinctive skateboard shape. In terms of aesthetics, I decided to spraypaint it a variety of different colors so
    that it would really "pop". In the end, I really enjoyed the process of creating my own skateboard and I would do it again anytime.
