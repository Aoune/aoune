    In this rotation, we learned the basics of HTML and participated in two class challenges. In the first challenge, each team had to build a stucture out of newspaper that could withstand being put in front of a fan. In the end, we constructed a newspaper cylinder that had another cylinder in the back supporting it. I suggested that we put flat squares of newspaper beneath each section of the newspaper. Our structed ending up holding together, but we got third place because two other teams had taller structures.
