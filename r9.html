  <h1>Rotation Nine: Arduino</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p>
    In this rotation, we had to complete numerous projects involving electronics using a hardware platform called Arduino. Below you will
    find pictures of all the completed projects and a description of what they do.

   <img src="90.jpg"/> Image 1: A circuit that makes the LED glow at different intensities depending on the dial.
  <br>
   <img src="91.jpg"/> Image 2: A circuit that makes the LED glow if a finger is placed on the touch-sensitive piece.
  <br>
   <img src="92.jpg"/> Image 3: A circuit that makes an LED change color depending on the dial and only glows with a finger touching it.
  <br>
   <img src="93.jpg"/> Image 4: A circuit that plays a short tune.
  <br>
   <img src="94.jpg"/> Image 5: A circuit with buttons that allows you to play musical notes.
  <br>
   <img src="95.jpg"/> Image 6: A circuit that lets you play a game where you have to press the correct button that correlates with the flashing light.
  <br>
   <img src="96.jpg"/> Image 7: A circuit whose LED changes color depending on the distance between an object and its distance sensor.
  <br>
   <img src="97.jpg"/> Image 8: A circuit whose motor turns depending on the turning of the dial.
  <br>
   <img src="98.jpg"/> Image 9: A circuit whose motor turns depending on the distance between an object and its distance sensor.
  <br>
   <img src="99.jpg"/> Image 10: A circuit whose screen displays a certain message.
  <br>
   <img src="901.jpg"/> Image 11: A circuit whose screen displays the temperature of the temperature sensor.
  <br>
   <img src="911.jpg"/> Image 12: A circuit that lets you play a game of guessing the specific animal.
