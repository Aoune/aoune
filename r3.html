  <h1>Rotation Three: Garment & Sublimation Printing</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p>
    In this rotation, we learned the basics of designing garments and sublimation printing. I had to make three different
    products: a tshirt, a mug, and a popsocket. The tshirt that I designed had to be related to either Ohio, Hudson, or WRA.
    I chose to make a WRA tshirt with a picture of the chapel in the center. To do this, I first had to create my design on CorelDRAW.
    Once I completed my design, I had to transport that image file to our tshirt design software called GTX Graphics Lab. I then had to
    transport that file to the tshirt printing machine. I pressed my tshirt to remove the wrinkled, then put it in the machine to print
    the design. After it was finished, I pressed it one more time to dry the wet ink. Overall, I'm happy with the way it turned out and
    it's a very quick and easy way to design tshirts.
