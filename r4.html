  <h1>Rotation Four: Laser Cutting & Engraving</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p>
    In this rotation, we learned the basics of laser cutting and engraving different objects. I made a bookmark, a water bottle, and a clock.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first thing that I made was a bookmark. I first had to measure the leather bookmark and create an image to laser engrave. The laser
    engraver can only recognize black and white, so even though my original image had colors, they did not appear on the final product. The
    process for making the bookmark was very quick, and it printed in a short period of time because of its small size.
