  <h1>Rotation Ten: Sewing & Embroidery</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p>
    In this rotation, we learned how to operation a sewing machine and create our own clothes. This is the process by which all of the
    clothes we wear is made, so it is important to understand how it happens. Our task was to create our own pair of pants from a piece
    of fabric. To do this, I first selected the fabric that I would use. I decided to choose two different ones, one for each leg. What
    followed was a series of multiple different sewing jobs in order to turn the fabric into a pair of pants. I had to sew each fabric
    into a pant leg, sew those two together to make a single pair of pants, and sew the top and bottom ends of the pants for a clean
    finish. After two class periods of sewing, I had something that resembled a pair of pants. I then had to use some leftover fabric
    to create a drawstring to run through the pants to tighten or loosen it. I finally had a pair of pants that I could wear to look
    super fashionable. I think the hardest part of the process was keeping the pants aligned on the sewing machine to make a straight edge.
    There were many times where I felt my sewing going off and potentially messing up the pants. Making these pants has given me a newfound
    appreciation for the people who make our clothes, because I realize now that just making a single article of clothing takes a lot of
    time and effort. In the end, I found the process to be enjoyable, and I take great pride in the spectacular pair of pants that I have
    created.
