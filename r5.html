  <h1>Rotation Five: 3D Printing & Scanning</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p> In this rotation, we learned the basics of scanning and printing 3D objects. We used MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers to print
    all of our assignments. This printer has a 25.2 x 19.9 x 15 cm build volume. It is an additive printer, meaning that it creates objects
    by stacking numerous layers of material on top of eachother. This is in contrast to subtractive printing, where material is removed in
    order to create an object. In this rotation we had to create a 3d model of our heads, a useful item using additive subtraction, and an
    object that couldn't be made using subtractive manufacturing.

    I first had to 3d print a model of my head. In order to do this, I first had my head scanned with a special tablet which would save
    the model as a .stl file. I then transported that file of my head to my computer and opened it on a software called Meshmixer. I also
    inserted a file of a column which I intended to put my head on. Using Meshmixer, I corrected any imperfections taken when scanning my
    head and combined my head and column to create one file. I then took this new .stl file and opened it on an application called MakerBot
    Print. I scaled the model to the size I desired and added supports so that it would unsupported parts of the model would have something
    supporting them so that they don't begin to droop. I saved that final model as a .print file and transported the file to the 3d printer
    and printed it. Overall, I think 3d printing is a fascinating concept and I love the idea of being able to design something 3d digitally
    and then having it come into existence through printing technology.

    My second assignment was to make something useful in the real world. I decided to make a phone stand so that I have an object to set
    my phone on when watching videos so that I don't have to hold it. I first had to create my model in Fusion 360. Once I finished that,
    I saved it as a .stl file and transported it to the MakerBot Print application. The rest of the process is the same as the first, except
    that I made sure that my model would be the right size to fit my phone. I then saved it as a .print file and printed it. The phone stand
    turned out well and comes in handy when I'm feeling lazy.

    My final assignment was to create something that couldn't be made using subtractive manufacturing. To do this, I had to create an
    object that couldn't be milled out by a simple subtractive printer. Recall, a subtractive printer works by having a small mill which
    descends to remove material from a base object, so if there is something obstructing the mill, it won't be able to complete the object.
    I designed an object that fits these parameters in Fusion 360 and printed it using the same process as the first two. I think it's a very
    cool looking object and is one that could not be made with subtractive printing. Subtractive printing had it's benefits, but it's not
    good for creating complex objects that have many facets.
