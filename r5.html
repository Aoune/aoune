  <h1>Rotation Five: 3D Printing & Scanning</h1>
  
  <hr style="width:40%">
  
  <p> In this rotation, we learned the basics of scanning and printing 3D objects. We used MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers to print
    all of our assignments. This printer has a 25.2 x 19.9 x 15 cm build volume. It is an additive printer, meaning that it creates objects
    by stacking numerous layers of material on top of eachother. This is in contrast to subtractive printing, where material is removed in
    order to create an object.
